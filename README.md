(OLD PROJECT - not used anymore)

Back in 2019, the Techfugees Kenya hackathon winning team, Faceless Hackers, presented a 3-module application to improve the efficiency in clinical conditions management in refugee camps in Kenya with an e-health solution that makes it easy to report, monitor, assess and act upon health related problems: 
1/ A mobile application for refugees to report health issues to the relevant authorities. It would automatically pick up the location of the person reporting the case, to facilitate tracking.
2/ The USSD app acts as a backup to the mobile application. It is used to report emergency cases, where it picks up the user details and their geographical locations. The USSD app will be useful where there’s limited internet connectivity, and for users with feature phones.
3/ Last, the Web Dashboard  is used to track patients’ progress and analyze the reports from refugees and CHVs, such that outbreaks can be flagged early and appropriate measures can be taken in due time.

This is the code of the first version of the app developed by Cliff Gor
